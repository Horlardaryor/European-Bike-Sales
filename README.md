I successfully finished the "Alex The Analyst" Excel portfolio project, 
utilizing slicers such as Marital Status, Gender, Geographical Region, Purchase Amount, and Education to discern trends in bicycle purchases between genders.
Throughout this analysis, I implemented diverse data cleaning techniques, generated column and line charts, utilized pivot tables, and culminated in the development of an interactive dashboard for convenient customer insights.
